## Tools

- KivyMD

## Planned updates

- Reviews to check if a restaurant is good
- A way to verify if a restaurant is real (by downvoting/reporting)
- A way to add a new location
  - Save as draft
- A way to recommend food places (1km radius?)
  - Maybe have presets to help? (In case food allergies, price range)

## How to set up project

### If the terminal is not already activated,

1. Open the project in whatever code editor you like, and open the terminal.
2. type pwd in terminal, this should display your current path
3. type `source <output in part 2>/venv/bin/activate`

5. Now just type `python3 main.py` and the app should run
